# Detecting Model Smells in UML Diagrams Using Large Language Models

This repository contains the source code, test data, and results for Bachelor's thesis:<br/>
**"Detecting Model Smells in UML Diagrams Using Large Language Models"**.

### 📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to test and analyze the detection of "Model Smells" (design flaws) in UML diagrams using LLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT).

- **Input:** UML diagrams (PDF) + Prompts (TXT).
- **Engine:** Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **Output:** JSON-structured analysis including empirical testing of identifying smells like _Redundancy_, _Inconsistencies_, etc.
- **Analysis:** Detailed results and comparisons are processed in **Jupyter Notebooks**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Models:** Gemini 3 Pro / GPT-5.1 / Claude Opus 4.5
- **Format:** JSON (ISO 8601 Timestamps)

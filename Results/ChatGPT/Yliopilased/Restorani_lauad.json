Each of these diagrams shows at least one central element such as a class, table, use case, or state, so there is no empty diagram."

All use cases are drawn within that system boundary, and there is no unambiguous evidence of any use-case oval that is completely unassociated with every actor, so this smell is not detected."

There is no pair of use cases that clearly describe the same activity while being associated with the same actor, so G6.1 does not apply."

Within any single package, each primary element name appears only once. Names that look similar across different packages or appear as classifier-type metadata are not repeated distinct elements within the same package, so no violation of G6.2 is visible."

There is no clear case where the same business data value is stored redundantly in multiple tables without a foreign-key connection, so denormalization per G6.3 is not observed."

According to the interpretation rules, these connectors imply multiplicity, and there is no clear instance of a UML-style association line between two elements that completely lacks multiplicity indicators or implied notation at both ends. Therefore, G15.3 is not triggered."

Use cases are central elements under this rule, and having 11 of them on a single diagram exceeds the threshold of 10, so S1.1 is detected for that diagram."

For example, in the diagram Laudade register transformed on page 14, the table laud connects to laua_kategooria_omamine, Laua_seisundi_liik, Ruum, and Tootaja but has fewer than six separate relationship lines. Therefore, S1.2 is not triggered."

In the activity diagrams on pages 3 and 4, the action names similarly begin with verbs such as Vaata, Otsi, Vali, Lopeta, Soovib vaadata, Kuvab, Annab korralduse, Teatab, and Aktiveerib.

On the class diagram Laudade register on page 10 and the transformed diagram Laudade register transformed on page 14, there is a class or table laua_kategooria_omamine and in the transformed diagram a table laud; both names begin with the lowercase letter l. These represent individual ownership records and individual tables rather than register collections, so this violates the convention that class or table names should start with an uppercase letter."

Where PK, FK, or index markers appear, for example PK laua_kood and FK ruumityyp_kood, the uppercase PK and FK prefixes are diagram annotations rather than part of the actual column name.

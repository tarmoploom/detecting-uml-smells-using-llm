**## 1. Role and Goal**

You are an expert Software Design Analyst. Your task is to analyze a provided UML as PDF file and identify potential "bad smells" based on a custom list of definitions.

**## 2. Knowledge base: Bad Smell Definitions**

The following is the complete and exclusive list of bad smell definitions you must use for this analysis. Do not use any prior knowledge about other bad smells.

G5.1: the model contains an empty diagram.
G5.2: a use case diagram has a use case (defined as a visual oval element) that is not associated with any actor. (Note: Do not apply this rule to text lists of functions inside Package/Subsystem symbols on overview diagrams).

G6.1: a use case diagram has two or more use cases whose names describe the same activity (e.g., 'Add Car', 'Register Car') and are associated with the same actor.
G6.2: a package diagram has multiple model elements with the same name in the same package.
G6.3: two or more tables contain a column that stores redundant copies of the same data value (denormalization) that are not connected by Foreign Key. (Note: Identically named columns like 'description' or 'id' in unrelated tables are NOT redundancy).

G8.1: inconsistent form is used in naming use cases (e.g., some start with a verb, others with a noun).

G15.1: a state diagram has a state that cannot be reached.
G15.2: an activity diagram has an action that cannot be reached.
G15.3: a class or database diagram has a relationship between two elements that lacks multiplicity indicators at both ends (e.g., 1, 0..*).

S1.1: a diagram has 10 or more central elements in total (classes, tables, use cases, or states). (Note: Actors, Packages, and elements on System Overview/Context diagrams are NOT counted as central elements).
S1.2: a single class or database diagram (one page/canvas) displays a class/table with 6 or more visual connection lines to other class/table on that specific diagram. (Ignore relationships defined in the model but not drawn on the current page).

S2.1: the distance between two related elements is more than twice the average distance between elements on the diagram.

N1.1: the name of a use case (visual oval element) or activity diagram action does not start with an active verb (e.g., 'Report' or 'Report Viewing' instead of 'View Report').
N1.2: the diagram contains a class, table, attribute, or use case whose name is too short (3 or less characters).

N3.1: a class name starts with a lowercase letter (e.g., car instead of Car) or is plural (e.g., Cars instead of Car).
N3.2: an attribute/column name starts with an uppercase letter (e.g., Description instead of description).
N3.3: a database table name is plural (e.g., Orders instead of Order).

N4.1: class, table or attribute name has prefix or abbreviation to the type of the element (e.g., tbl_Customers, uc_AddUser, strName). (Note: 'PK_', 'FK_', 'pfK', and 'IXFK_' to indicate primary keys, foreign keys, partial foreign keys and indexes are allowed).

**## 3. Input Data: UML as PDF file**

The following UML as PDF file to be analyzed is represented in PDF format, containing information about (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).

**## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Parse the UML:** First, carefully review the provided UML as PDF file. Do what you think is necessary to understand the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them (inheritance, association, dependency, etc.).
2.  **Analyze for Bad Smells:** For each bad smell defined in the "Knowledge base" section, systematically analyze the parsed UML to determine if there are any instances of that smell.
3.  **Justify Your Findings:** For each identified bad smell, provide a clear and concise explanation of why it is considered a smell in the context of the provided diagram. Reference specific classes, methods, or relationships in your justification.
4.  **Consolidate the Results:** Present your findings in the specified output format. If no bad smells are found for a particular category, explicitly state it 

**## 5. Required Output Format**

Provide your analysis in a structured JSON format as follows. Ensure all fields are accurately filled out.

json example below:

```json
{
  "file_name": "short name for the result",
  "smell_analysis": [
    {
      "rule_id": "G5.1",
      "detected": false,
      "justification": "No empty diagrams were found."
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "G5.2",
      "detected": false,
      "justification": "All packages in the diagram are connected."
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "G8.1",
      "detected": true,
      "justification": "Found inconsistent naming conventions: 'Isik' (Estonian) vs 'User' (English)."
    }
    // ... continue for all rules
  ]
}
